Infragram
======

The Infragram project brings together a range of different efforts to make Do-It-Yourself plant health comparisons possible with infrared photography.

This project is a minimal core of the Infragram project in JavaScript and was made possible with support from Google and the AREN Project at NASA.

## Quick Installation
1. Fork our repo from https://github.com/publiclab/infragram.
2. In the console, download a copy of your forked repo with `git clone https://github.com/your_username/infragram` where `your_username` is your GitHub username.
3. Enter the new infagram directory with `cd infragram`.
4. `npm install` - this will install all the node packages into your local machine.
5. `npm install http-server -g && http-server` (this installs http-server globally and then runs it, next time you just need to do `http-server` to run it locally)
